                            <h2 class="text-light"> What is a Password Cracking Lab?</h2>
                            <p>A password cracking lab is an environment where you can practice and understand the
                                methods used to crack passwords. It's primarily used by ethical hackers and
                                cybersecurity professionals to test and improve security measures. Unlike malicious
                                hacking, which aims to exploit vulnerabilities for nefarious purposes, ethical hacking
                                focuses on identifying and fixing security flaws.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-light">The Important Parts of a Password Cracking Lab</h2>
                            <strong>Hardware Requirements</strong>
                            <strong>CPU and GPU:</strong>
                            <p>
                                Invest in high-performance CPUs with several cores for speedier calculation if you want
                                a comprehensive password-cracking lab. GPUs play an equally vital role, as they greatly
                                speed up the password cracking process, particularly when using programmes such as
                                Hashcat.

                            </p>
                            <strong>Memory (RAM):</strong>
                            <p>
                                Managing big datasets and executing numerous apps at once require RAM that is 16GB or
                                greater.
                            </p>

                                            <p>Updating your iOS device is important because updates often include
                                                security patches that fix known vulnerabilities. Keeping your device
                                                updated ensures you have the latest protections against cyber
                                                threats.
