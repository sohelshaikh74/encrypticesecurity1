                What are File Inclusion Vulnerabilities ?
              </h2>
              <p>
                When a web application permits the inclusion of files without the necessary validation, file inclusion
                vulnerabilities arise. This may result in the disclosure of private data, the execution of arbitrary
                code, and other nefarious actions. Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) are the
                two primary categories of file inclusion vulnerabilities.
              </p>



              <h3 class="text-light">
                What are Types of File Inclusion Vulnerabilities
              </h3>
              <br />

              <p><strong>Local File Inclusion (LFI): </strong></p>
              <p>
                When a hacker manipulates a web application to include files from the local server, it's known as local
                file inclusion (LFI). This exposes private data, including configuration files and logs, and may even
                permit arbitrary code execution. Encryptic security highlights how crucial it is to use tools to find
                file inclusion flaws in order to stop local file inclusion attacks and protect important data.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Remote File Inclusion (RFI):</strong></p>
              <p>
                When an attacker adds files from an external server, it's known as remote file inclusion (RFI), which
                allows remote scripts to be executed on the targeted server and ultimately compromises the system.
                Strong security measures are needed to guard against remote file inclusion vulnerabilities. Encryptic
                Security advises using sophisticated tools to find file inclusion vulnerabilities, as the OWASP
                recommendations emphasise, in order to stop these destructive file inclusion attacks.
              </p>

              <h3 class="text-light">Wfuzz</h3>
              <span class="text-light"><strong>Overview of Acunetix</strong></span>

              <p>Wfuzz is a flexible tool for web application security that may be used to brute-force web applications
                in order to find different types of vulnerabilities, such as file inclusion. It may be used to automate
                the process of evaluating web apps for potential security flaws and is quite customisable. Wfuzz is a
                crucial tool for locating local file inclusion (LFI) and remote file inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities
                since it can be very helpful in locating hidden files and folders.

              </p>

              <p><strong>How to Utilize Wfuzz for File Inclusion Testing</strong></p>

              <span class="text-light"><strong>Install Wfuzz:</strong></span>
              <p>Download and install Wfuzz on your system from its official repository.
              </p>

              <span class="text-light"><strong>Create a Wordlist:</strong></span>
              <p> Generate a wordlist of potential file paths and filenames that might be used in a file inclusion
                attack. This can include common file paths, configuration files, and other potentially sensitive files.

              </p>
              <span class="text-light"><strong>Brute-Force File Inclusion Points:</strong></span>
              <p>Use Wfuzz to brute-force potential file inclusion points in the web application by specifying the
                target URL and the wordlist. This process involves sending numerous requests to the server, attempting
                to include each file in the wordlist.
              </p>
              <span class="text-light"><strong>Analyze Output:</strong></span>
              <p> Review the output generated by Wfuzz to identify any successful file inclusions. This analysis will
                help you pinpoint vulnerabilities that could be exploited in a file inclusion attack</p>
