                  Common Threats to Business Logic Security
                </h2>
                <br />

                <p><strong>Injection-Based Attacks</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Business logic vulnerabilities are flaws in the design or
                  implementation of an application's processes. These business
                  logic flaw vulnerabilities occur when an application does not
                  properly enforce the intended business rules or processes.
                  Unlike traditional security vulnerabilities, such as SQL
                  injection or cross-site scripting, logic vulnerabilities are
                  specific to the applicationâ€™s workflow and how it handles data
                  and operations. Security vulnerabilities in business logic can
                  result in unauthorized actions, financial loss, or exposure of
                  sensitive information. Detecting these flaws requires a deep
                  understanding of the business processes involved.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Authorization Flaws</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Applications that have problems in the way they offer users
                  permissions are said to have authorization vulnerabilities.
                  Attackers can access restricted regions without authorization
                  thanks to these business logic defect vulnerabilities,
                  jeopardising sensitive data and system integrity. Inadequate
                  role-based access controls, for example, may allow a normal
                  user to carry out administrative tasks. Fixing permission
                  issues is crucial to preserving strong business logic security
                  and enhancing operational effectiveness.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Workflow Bypasses</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Workflow bypasses happen when attackers find ways to skip
                  critical steps in business process automation. This type of
                  business logic flaw can result in incomplete transactions or
                  unauthorized activities. For example, an attacker might bypass
                  payment verification in an e-commerce application, leading to
                  financial losses. Ensuring that all workflow steps are
                  correctly enforced and validated is vital for preventing these
                  vulnerabilities and safeguarding the overall business logic
                  security of the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Implementing business logic security best practices, such as
                  secure coding techniques and regular vulnerability
                  assessments, can significantly improve operational efficiency
                  and prevent workflow bypasses. Conducting thorough penetration
                  testing can help identify and rectify these issues, mitigating
                  the potential impact of business logic vulnerabilities on
                  businesses.
                </p>

                  API misuse involves attacks on inadequately secured API
                  security implementations. APIs are crucial for integrating
                  various systems and services, but poorly protected APIs can
                  expose business logic vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit
                  these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access or manipulate
                  data exchanges. Implementing strict authentication,
                  authorization, and data validation protocols for APIs is
                  critical to mitigate the risks of API misuse and maintain
                  secure business logic.
                </p>

                </p>

                <p><strong>Data Manipulation</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Data manipulation refers to the unauthorized alteration of
                  data flows within an application to disrupt or defraud
                  business operations. This threat exploits business logic flaw
                  vulnerabilities to change transaction amounts, alter user
                  data, or manipulate system behaviors. For example, an attacker
                  might modify transaction values to benefit financially.
                  Protecting against data manipulation requires robust data
                  validation, integrity checks, and regular web application
                  security testing to identify and address potential
