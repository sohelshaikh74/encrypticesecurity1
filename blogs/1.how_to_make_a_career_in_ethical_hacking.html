                  In the world of cybersecurity, ethical hacking—also referred
                  to as white-hat hacking—is essential. In order to find
                  weaknesses and enhance general security, it entails authorised
                  attempts to break into networks, applications, or systems. A
                  thorough training programme, such as ethical hacker training
                  or CEH training, is required to become a certified ethical
                  hacker (CEH) and acquire the skills necessary for ethical
                  hacking techniques. In today's digital world, this
                  professional path not only provides a fulfilling career in
